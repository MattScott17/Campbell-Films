            I&apos;m a photographer and Super 8 filmmaker based in Southern California.
            I shoot primarily on film to create nostalgic, warm, and candid images and
            videos that feel timeless and true to the moment. I&apos;m drawn to the way
            film captures real, in-the-moment emotions and turns them into something you can feel.

            Film loves the in-between moments. The way you looked at each other when you
            thought no one was watching. Your mom fixing your veil. That burst of laughter
            during cocktail hour. These are the moments that make your story yours.
